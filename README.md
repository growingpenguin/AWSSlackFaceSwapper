**1.User Uploads Image via Canva (Frontend)** <br/>
The user interacts with Canva, which is the frontend of your application <br/>
The user uploads an image through Canva <br/>
**2.Canva Requests a Pre-signed URL** <br/>
Canva (the frontend) sends a request to an AWS Lambda function asking for a pre-signed URL <br/>
This URL allows the image to be securely uploaded to an S3 bucket without needing direct access to S3 <br/>
**3.Canva Uploads the Image to S3** <br/>
Canva receives the pre-signed URL from the Lambda function and uses it to upload the user's image directly to the S3 bucket <br/>
**4.S3 Triggers a Lambda Function** <br/>
Once the image is successfully uploaded to S3, this triggers another Lambda function (using S3 event notifications) <br/>
**5.Lambda Processes the Image Using the AI Model** <br/>
The triggered Lambda function retrieves the uploaded image from S3 and sends it to an AI model running on an EC2 instance (or within the Lambda function if itâ€™s small enough) to perform tasks like face detection, face swapping, or any other AI-based processing <br/>
**6.Processed Image is Saved Back to S3** <br/>
The AI model processes the image and the resulting processed image is saved back to the S3 bucket <br/>
**7.Lambda Generates a Pre-signed URL for the Processed Image** <br/>
After saving the processed image, Lambda generates another pre-signed URL for the processed image and sends this URL back to Canva.
**8.User Views the Processed Image on Canva** <br/>
Canva receives the pre-signed URL for the processed image and displays the image to the user, allowing them to see the result of the AI processing <br/>
